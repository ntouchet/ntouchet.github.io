## What is Electric Soup?
This page is mainly dedicated to the discussion of work that relates to Electrical Engineering, but will also include
other topics that interest me. I hope to write about ongoing and completed projects, books that I have read, courses
that I am taking, research that I am conducting, and whatever else I want to write about.  

This page is also meant as a personal accountability system for my ongoing learning. I recently started reading through
a textbook, and after finishing the the first assignment, I realized that I had no one to turn it in to. So, I decided to turn it 
in to the internet, but since no-one is likely to read it, it's more like turning it in to myself, which is just as good, if not 
better.  

## Who am I?
My name is Nathan Touchet and I currently live in Houston Texas. I recently graduated from The University of Houston with 
a B.S. in Electrical Engineering, and want to continue learning for as long
 as I'm able.  

I love music. I play guitar, write, and sing in a band (@orin.largette on instagram) and I like working on music technology
projects in my spare time. 

## Contact Me
If you are looking at this website for now, I assume that you already know me and can get my contact.

I will eventually setup an email specifically for this website and any randos can use that to contact me.
